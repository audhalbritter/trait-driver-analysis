## Methods

This section contains the experimental design and all the references used for the data analysis of this manuscript.


```{r mountain, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = '90%', fig.cap="Experimental set up of the Mt. Gongga elevational experiment. There are four experimental study sites across the 1,130m elevational gradient. The arrows reflect the different tuff transplant experiments between these sites. The rectangles depict one of seven experimental blocks at each altitude, where squares reflect transplants and the hexagon an OTC). The colours reflect temperature treatments (orange = ca 1.75°C warmer, red = 5.3°C warmer, light blue =   ca 1.75°C colder, red = 5.3°C colder, green = control).  Within each of the seven blocks at each site, plots were randomly designated to six different experimental treatments: (i) passive warming with an open top chamber (OTC; all sites); (ii) transplanting to a site one step warmer along the gradient (warming; from sites High alpine, Alpine); (iii) Middle alpine transplanting to a site one step colder along the gradient (cooling; from sites Alpine, Middle alpine, and Lowland); (iv) transplanting down the entire gradient (extreme warming; from site High alpine); (v) transplanting up the entire gradient (extreme cooling, from site Lowland); (vi) transplanting within blocks within all sites (to control for the transplanting itself and a local transplant); (vii) an untouched control plot (Control; all sites). Thus, in every site, each OTC has a local unmanipulated control, and each transplanted turf has an “origin” site and a “destination” site, with two types of controls, local transplant and untouched plots."}

Here is another conceptual figure.


```{r concept-fig, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE,  out.width = '100%', fig.cap="Conceptual figure showing the experimetnal design with traits changing along a gradienta and transplanting traits along the gradient. Trait imputation, bootstrapping and higher moments. And divergence - convergence."}

### Software

All analyses were done in R v. `r getRversion()` [@R] and used
traitstrap v. `r packageVersion("traitstrap")` [@traitstrap] to impute traits,
e1071 v. `r packageVersion("e1071")` [@e1071] to calculate moments,
and tidyverse v. `r packageVersion("tidyverse")` [@tidyverse].
Packages drake v. `r packageVersion("drake")` [@drake],
rmarkdown `r packageVersion("rmarkdown")` [@rmarkdown1] and
renv v. `r packageVersion("renv")` [@renv] were used to ensure reproducibility.
Code to reproduce all the analyses is archived at [https://github.com/richardjtelford/trait-driver-analysis](https://github.com/richardjtelford/trait-driver-analysis).

## Results

This section contains all figures and tables of the main manuscript. The figures show responses in plant community composition and plant functional trait composition to climate  and climate change treatments treatments.


### Trait-climate correlations

This figure shows the correlation of trait mean and temperature, representing the elevational gradient.


```{r trait-climate, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Relationship between functional traits and summer air temperature (2m above ground). The trait values are bootstrapped community weighted traits from control plots in 2016. The regression line is shown (grey dashed) and significant relationships are indicated with a solid red line. The shaded area displays the confidence interval. The traits are sorted from positive slope, no significant to negative slope."}

This is a principle componant analysis showing plant community composition for the different treatments in all sites.

### Colonization and extinction

Here we present the number of species that colonize and go extinct in the different climate treatments.

```{r colo_ext_plot, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Realized (closed bar) and expected (open bar) colonization (up) or extinction (down) for each climate treatment. Colonization and extinction are expressed as mean number of species per plot and treatment."}

```

Here we present the abundance of species that colonize and go extinct in the different climate treatments.

```{r colo_ext_plot2, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Realized (closed bar) and expected (open bar) colonization (up) or extinction (down) for each climate treatment. Colonization and extinction are expressed as mean abundance per plot and treatment."}

Temporal variation in effect sizes for each measured trait. The first column shows traits divergence and the second column trait convergence. The grey panels labeled with Positive slope, No slope and Negative slopes show the predicted outcome according to TDT, depending on the traits relationship with summer air temperature (see New Fig. 2). The colour of the lines indicates the transplant treatment: transplant to 1.75°C warmer (red), transplant to 0.5°C warmer (pink), OTC (orange), transplant to 0.5°C colder (light blue), transplant to 1.75°C colder (dark blue).

Temporal variation in effect sizes for each measured trait. The first column shows traits divergence and the second column trait convergence.

The two columns show two scenarios of trait plasticity. Divergence reflects a conservative scenario, where treatments are compared to the origin control and do not allow for trait plasticity. Contrary, convergence reflects full plasticity where treatments are compared to the destination controls."}
